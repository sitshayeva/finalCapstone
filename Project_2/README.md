## Project Description
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. This project delves into the categorization of NLP applications and explores their importance in different use cases. It covers applications such as email classification, essay grading assistance, and diagnostic support for doctors. By understanding the potential of NLP, we can harness its capabilities to solve complex language-related tasks efficiently.

## Use-Case Categorization
This section categorizes NLP applications for three specific use cases and highlights the importance and functionality of each application. It includes:

1. Email Classification for Inbox Organization:
   - Description: A model that allocates emails to specific folders based on their content, similar to Gmail's inbox tabs.
   - Category: Text Classification
   - Importance: Streamlines email organization and improves efficiency for users.

2. Essay Grading Assistance for University Professors:
   - Description: A model that helps university professors assign grades to essay questions.
   - Category: Automatic Summarization
   - Importance: Facilitates the grading process for professors handling multiple classes or essay competitions.

3. Diagnostic Assistance for Doctors:
   - Description: A model that provides assistive technology for doctors to aid in making diagnoses.
   - Category: Question Answering
   - Importance: Helps doctors by providing probable diagnoses based on patient answers, improving diagnostic accuracy.

## Innovative Technologies
This section highlights the innovative technologies developed by major companies in the NLP domain. It provides a summary of each technology and its application. The technologies covered include:

- Google: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- IBM: Watson
- Facebook: Language Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Content Filtering
- Amazon: Recommendation Systems
- Apple: Virtual Assistant (Siri)
- Netflix: Recommendation System

The overview explains the achievements and functionalities of these technologies and how they employ advanced NLP techniques to enhance user experiences.
